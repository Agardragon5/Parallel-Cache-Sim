MSI simple:

Very straightforward, just a bunch of loads to the same address,
MI should cause a large number of invalidations, everything else should cause 0


MSI modify basic:

Same idea, load the same addr a bunch of time, but then P0 will store, and P1 will store,
should trigger 8 invalidations

MSI multiple lines:

P2 and P3 share a line which P2 writes too, P0 and P1 doing their own things,
we should only see 1 invalidation here 

MSI invalidate while modified:

Two PEs this time, which both try to store, the idea is that this should (hopefully), trigger 
two invalidations, including one while a line is in the M state
